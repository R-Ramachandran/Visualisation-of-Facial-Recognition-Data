# Visualisation-of-Facial-Recognition-Data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of Real-time Data Visualization of Facial Expression Data using Keras and Plotly is to detect and classify 
human facial expressions from image sequence this is also used to cope with emotional health problems caused 
due to our negativity in our day to day lives. This software uses biometric markers to detect emotions in human faces. 
More precisely, this technology is a sentiment analysis tool and is able to automatically detect the six basic or 
universal expressions: happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust. Emotional health plays very important 
role to improve peopleâ€™s quality of lives, especially for the elderly. This kind of improvement is an important progress 
in this artificial intelligence era. Facials expressions plays a key role in our daily communications. Many deep 
learning approaches have been applied in recent years due to their outstanding recognition accuracy after training 
with large amounts of data. This can be done basically in here steps: Firstly, Locating faces in the scene, in an 
image or video footage. Secondly, extracting information about facial features from detected faces and finally 
analyzing the movement of facial features or changes in the appearance of facial features and classifying this 
information into expression-interpretative categories such as facial muscle activations like smile or frown; emotion 
categories happiness or anger.
